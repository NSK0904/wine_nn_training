# wine_nn_training
Train classifier for sklearn wine dataset using Neural Network approach.

# Aim

Learn the basic steps of creating and training of neural networks.

# Workflow

1) Select sklearn wine dataset.
2) Create a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) for classification task.
3) Prepare data for training (divide into training and testing subsets, normalize them).
4) Select hyperparameters.
5) Prepare a code for training.
6) Perform neural network training.
7) Check the performance of the neural network applying classification metrics.
8) Save the weights of the trained network.
